Discord Bot Written In Ruby

Dependencies Required:

  - [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/)
  - [Discordrb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb)

Discord Voice Chat bot created with Ruby, this utilizes several APIs and concepts that I haven't used before:

  - Discordrb Discord Bot creator
  - Reddit API
  - XML Scraper (Nokogiri)
  - HTML Scraper (Also Nokogiri)
  - MyAnimeList API
  - Giphy API
  
Meant to be a way for me to learn and practice Ruby as I have only used once before very briefly. Also a way to 
learn several useful technologies that I haven't had experience with (XML and HTML scraper).

Example commands:

  - !hi     Offers a friendly greeting the user who called it
  - !reddit Given a subreddit, category, and a number between 1-25, prints that many posts from the subreddit
  - !anime  Given an anime, posts the synopsis along with several other characteristics of the show (My Anime List API)
  - And Many More!
